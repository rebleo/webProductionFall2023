### 💾   Pair programming presentation net.art project

##### In class presentations are due Monday October 25
With a partner, choose 1 artwork from either the [Rhizome's net.art Anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) or [Chronus Art Center's WE-LINK online exhibitions](http://we-link.chronusartcenter.org/) to present to the class in a 5  minute presentation. If you want to do a creative response to the artwork (a hyper text narrative of your own inspired by Olia Lialina or a zoom performance inspired by another artist, etc) that is also a way to go.

* You MUST create your [slide deck](https://www.google.com/search?q=slide+deck&oq=slide+deck&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l9.3609j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) using HTML, CSS + host on your class site. Each slide should be a relative link to another html page or a more sophisticated system if you choose. Use an external styling sheet to keep the styling of your presentation uniform. 
* Your slide deck website must include:
  * A clear wireframe and plan for execution
  * it's own directory + file path linked from your class site home page
  * Multiple HTML pages controlled by 1 external styling sheet
  * Flex and Grid Display on some portion of the pages
  * Some navigation with links to relative file path to go to the next "slide"
  * at least one [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)
  * at least one instance of CSS [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) + one [id](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors)
  * At least three pictures and an "images" or "assets" directory to hold your media. A "pages" or "slides" directory to hold your pages.
* Post a link to your net.art Presentation Web Site (Slide Deck) 
* Remember this is a presentation to the class. We should hear from both people in the partnership on both the response to the artwork as well as the code itself. And if you want to somehow make yr presention interactive // inspired by the work you reserached - that's even better!

##### For nxt class - October 18  
For next week. Research which artwork you would like to present or are inspired by. **Meet with yr partner irl or remotely** Discuss with your partner and once you decide post a link to the work by your names as well as a selfie from your meeting nxt to it [here](https://github.com/rebleo/webProductionFall2023/wiki/Week-07). **You can not do an artwork that has been posted by another pair!!** 

Come to class with a web page prototype that houses your concept, inspiration, wire frames and plan of execution.
