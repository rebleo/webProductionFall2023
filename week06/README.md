##### Assignment 6
Catch up on any missed assignments. Post links to the proper week by Wednesday October 11 at 3pm - when I will look at them!! This includes the async work as well as the assigned homework.

This will be the **last** chance to get any credit for 1-3. And if you thoughtfully responsd to the week's reading / prompt AND cover all the technical parameters you can get 6 out of 10 points. More points will be deducted for sub par work, as always.
